## 📚 Creating Your First Storybook with Gemini

### Step 1: Generate Stories with Gemini Storybook

1. **Open Gemini AI** and access the **Storybook Gem**
2. **Upload an image** of your little one for character inspiration
3. **Describe your story concept** with details like:
   - Theme or adventure type
   - Characters you want included
   - Setting (magical forest, space, underwater, etc.)
   - Moral or lesson you want to teach
4. **Specify appropriate age** for the book (e.g., "ages 4-8")
5. **Generate multiple versions** - create as many stories as you want!

### Step 2: Export Your Storybook from Gemini

Following the brilliant guide from [Reddit user's workaround](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1mjufo3/cant_export_the_pdf_file_or_print_the_storybook/):

#### 🔍 Extract HTML Content:

1. **Open your generated storybook** in Gemini
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Find the storyboard container** (look for `div` with `ngcontent` or similar)
4. **Right-click → Copy Element** to get the complete HTML structure
5. **Save this HTML** in a text file for later use

#### 📸 Download All Images:

1. **Install a Chrome extension** for batch image downloads:
   - Recommended: [Image Downloader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj)
2. **Open the storybook page** with the extension active
3. **Extension will automatically detect** all story images
4. **Select all images** and click download
5. **Clean up unnecessary images** and **rename them sequentially**: `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, `3.jpg`... `11.jpg`

#### 📁 Organize Your Project:

```
your-storybook-project/
├── images/
│   ├── 1.jpg (cover)
│   ├── 2.jpg
│   ├── 3.jpg
│   └── ... (up to 11.jpg or however many you have)
└── (HTML file will go here)
```

```
[INSERT THE PROMPT TEMPLATE FROM STEP 4 HERE - see below]
```

### Step 4: The Ultimate Storybook Prompt Template (V2)

**Copy and paste this enhanced prompt, filling in your specific details:**

---

### Prompt Template for a Fully Responsive Storybook Web App (V2)

**Role:** You are an expert front-end web developer specializing in creating beautiful, responsive, and self-contained web applications using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Objective:** Create a single, complete HTML file for a responsive children's storybook web application. The application must be in Hebrew and follow all functional and technical specifications outlined below to ensure a perfect, bug-free user experience on all devices.

**Project Inputs:**

- **Book Title:** `[Enter the title of your book here]`
- **Total Number of Images:** `[Enter the total number of images, e.g., 11]`
- **Story Content (Text for each page, corresponding to images 2 through the end):**
  1. `[Enter text for the first story page]`
  2. `[Enter text for the second story page]`
  3. `[Continue for all story pages...]`

---

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Initial View (Cover Page):**

   - The application must load to a **single-page cover view**.
   - This view must display the **Book Title** and use the first image (`images/1.jpg`) as its background or main element.

2. **Navigation & Pagination:**

   - Provide "הבא" (Next) and "הקודם" (Previous) buttons for navigation.
   - Clicking "הבא" from the cover transitions to the first two-page spread.
   - Subsequent "הבא" clicks must advance by one full spread (2 pages).
   - **Crucially, the "הבא" button must be disabled on the final spread** to prevent navigation to empty pages. The logic should be equivalent to `nextButton.disabled = currentPageIndex + 2 >= storyData.length;`.
   - Clicking "הקודם" from the first spread must return to the cover.

3. **Two-Page Spread View:**

   - After the cover, all views are two-page spreads, displayed side-by-side on desktop screens.
   - Each spread must consist of one page dedicated entirely to an image and one page dedicated entirely to text.
   - **The layout of these pages must alternate with each spread:**
     - Spread 1 (Pages 1-2): **Image on the right**, **Text on the left**.
     - Spread 2 (Pages 3-4): **Text on the right**, **Image on the left**.
     - This alternating pattern must continue throughout the book.

4. **Responsiveness (Mobile and Zoom):**
   - The layout must be **fully responsive** and work perfectly on mobile devices or when zoomed in.
   - Use a CSS media query for screens with a `max-width` of **768px**.
   - On these smaller screens, the two-page spread must collapse into a **single vertical column**, with the two pages stacking one on top of the other.
   - **Image Integrity:** Images must **never be cropped or cut off**. They must always be fully visible within their container.

---

### **Technical & Styling Specifications**

- **File Structure:** The entire application must be a **single `.html` file**.
- **Language & Direction:** The document must be `lang="he"` and `dir="rtl"`.
- **Styling:**
  - Use **Tailwind CSS** loaded from its official CDN.
  - For the main story images, you **must** use the CSS property `object-fit: contain;` to prevent cropping.
- **Fonts:** Use the **'Assistant'** font from Google Fonts.
- **JavaScript:**
  - Use **vanilla JavaScript** only. No external frameworks.
  - Place the script inside a `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.
- **Image Paths:** Assume all images are in a local `./images/` directory, with paths like `images/1.jpg`. Include a simple `onerror` fallback for broken image links.
- **Data Structure:** The core logic must be driven by a JavaScript array. This array **must** be structured to separate content types (cover, image, text) to facilitate the alternating layout. Example:

```javascript
const storyData = [
  { type: "cover", image: "images/1.jpg", title: "..." },
  // Spread 1 (Image | Text)
  { type: "image", src: "images/2.jpg" },
  { type: "text", content: "Text for page 1..." },
  // Spread 2 (Text | Image)
  { type: "text", content: "Text for page 2..." },
  { type: "image", src: "images/3.jpg" },
  // and so on...
];
```

Please generate the complete, production-ready HTML file based on these precise specifications.

### Step 5: Finalize Your Storybook

1. **Copy the generated HTML code** from Gemini
2. **Create a new file** named `index.html` in your project folder
3. **Paste the code** and save
4. **Test locally** by opening the HTML file in your browser

## 🚀 Integration with Princess Milay's Library

### Step 6: Add to Your Digital Library

1. **Rename your project folder** to follow the library convention:

   ```
   book1/    (for your first story)
   book2/    (for your second story)
   book3/    (etc.)
   ```

2. **Ensure your folder structure** matches the library requirements:

   ```
   book1/
   ├── index.html (your storybook app)
   └── images/
       ├── 1.jpg (this becomes the cover in library)
       ├── 2.jpg
       └── ... (rest of your story images)
   ```

3. **Update your HTML `<title>` tag** with the story name:

   ```html
   <title>הסיפור המדהים של מיליי</title>
   ```

4. **Place your book folder** in the same directory as the library's main `index.html`

5. **Refresh the library** - it will automatically discover your new book! ✨
